    {
      "id": "REQ-14",
      "text": "Improve the Celebration page’s user prompt shown when background music autoplay is blocked so it is more explicit and reassuring about what the user should do to start the music (keep all user-facing text in English).",
      "target": "frontend",

      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "When the browser blocks autoplay, the Celebration page shows a clear on-screen prompt instructing the user to tap a button to start the music.",
        "The prompt remains visible until the user successfully starts playback or an audio load/play error is detected.",
        "All user-facing strings added or changed for this prompt are in English.",
        "The existing Play Music action still triggers audio playback via the existing handler (no regressions to the current flow)."

  "constraints": [
    "Do not edit files under frontend/src/components/ui (read-only Shadcn components).",
    "Do not edit any paths listed in frontend.immutablePaths (compose alternatives instead).",
    "Keep the backend as a single Motoko actor; do not add additional backend services.",
    "Reference static media directly from frontend/public/assets/generated (do not proxy audio/images through the backend)."
  ],
  "nonGoals": [
    "Changing the 3-page navigation/flow (Proposal → Celebration → Future Family).",
    "Adding any new authentication provider beyond Internet Identity.",
    "Adding new backend persistence or APIs."
